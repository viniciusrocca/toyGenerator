# toyGenerator
A simplified Monte carlo event generator used to simulate the generation of a Higgs boson as a signal and your decay in two photons.

## Generator Structure 

The following image represents the structure of the simplified Monte Carlo simulator. Where:

  * Particles 1 and 2 are partons.
  * Particle X is a Higgs boson.
  * Particle Y is a parton.
  * Particles A and B are photons.
  * The squares represents the detectors.
